# Ion Launcher

**Small**: The launcher is made to take up as little space as possible (within reason)

**Unobtrusive**: Elements are arranged in an optimal way for muscle memory and reachability

**Productive**: The launcher shows you relevant information on the home screen when its needed

**Elegant**: The design does not take a back seat in this launcher, the default setup looks great, and you can make it look even better with a couple adjustments

## Future goals

- Hiding apps
- More stuff in search
- Under 1MB APK size (let me dream)

### Paid extension app
I plan on making a paid extension app to monetize this somehow,
it would have integrations with specific (and maybe proprietary)
things, like google, telegram, microsoft...
