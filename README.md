# Ion Launcher

**Small**: The launcher is made to take up as little space as possible (within reason)

**Unobtrusive**: Elements are arranged in an optimal way for muscle memory and reachability

**Productive**: The launcher shows you relevant information on the home screen when its needed

**Elegant**: The design does not take a back seat in this launcher, the default setup looks great, and you can make it look even better with a couple adjustments
